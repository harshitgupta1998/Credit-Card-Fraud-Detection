Isolation Forest has a 99.75% more accurate than LOF of 99.71% 
When comparing error precision & recall for 2 models , the Isolation Forest performed better than the LOF as we can see that the detection of fraud cases.
So overall Isolation Forest Method performed much better in determining the fraud cases.
I further plan to explore neural autoencoder which could be here. Since, the number of fraud cases is neglible when compared to normal cases.
